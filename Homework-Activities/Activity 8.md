# 1. Diagram showing what the binary search tree would look like

# 2. If a well-balanced search tree contained 1000 values, what is the maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value within it?

# 3. Write an algorithm that finds the greatest value within a binary tree.

# 4. Write code in C++ that implements the task from #1. Only insertion operations are required.
