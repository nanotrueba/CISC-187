Sorting Algorithms
# Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 4N + 16 steps.
Focusing on the leading term ‘4N’ we can describe the time complexity of the algorithm
as O(N).
# Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 2N^2.
The leading term is ‘2N^2’ which means we can describe the time complexity of the
algorithm as O(N^2).
# Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function, which returns
the sum of all numbers of an array after the numbers have been doubled:
The process of iterating through “array” and adding the modified element to the array
“doubled_array” takes O(N) time as it must perform the action to all elements in the list which is
size N. Then, the process of summing each element in “doubled_array” and returning the sum
also takes O(N) as it must perform the operation to each element in “doubled_array” which is of
size N. Then our final time complexity is expressed as O(N) + O(N) which results in 2 * O(N).
Because we only care about the end behavior of the function, we can disregard the coefficient 2
and we can see that our final time complexity for this function is O(N).
# Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function, which accepts
an array of strings and prints each string in multiple cases:
This function iterates through the array of strings and prints it in different formats. This
operation applies to each element of the array which is size N but applies constant time
operations O(1). Because we the constant time operations don’t affect the highest order of the
time complexity, O(N), the time complexity of the function named ‘multiple_cases’ remains O(N).
# The next function iterates over an array of numbers, and for each number whose index is
even, it prints the sum of that number plus every number in the array. What is this function’s
efficiency in terms of Big O Notation?
The function ‘every_other’ begins with a loop that iterates through each element in the
array which takes O(N) time. Then there is another loop that iterates through all even elements
in the array, which takes 1/2 * O(N) time. Combining these functions, we disregard the
coefficients and are left with a loop within a loop [O(N) * O(N)] which results in O(N^2) time.
