## 1. Assume you have a simple single-dimensional array. array = [200, 400, 100, 50, 350]; Linear search will take O(N). Write a code in C++/Python to improve the search operation efficiency from O(N)to O(1).

## 2. Use C++ to generate the hash value of your name

## 3. With the help of a figure, explain the problem that occured due to introducing a tombstone to mark the deleted cell.
