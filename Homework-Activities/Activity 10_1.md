# Objective: "Implement Breadth-first search and Depth-first search algorithms in C++"
### 1. Create a theoretical graph using a pen and paper OR electronically.

### 2. Implement the graph created in step 1 and apply breadth and depth-first search algorithms using C++.

### 3. Compare both search algorithms in the context of Big O notations.
